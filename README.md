# bulk-email-excel
A Python script to send personalized bulk emails (marketing, sponsorship, etc.) with attachments using Excel.

This Python script allows you to send marketing, sponsorship, or other bulk emails with just one click.

Add your message content directly in the code.

Store recipient information (such as names, email addresses, and custom fields) in an Excel file.

Define your PDF attachment path in the code (optional).

The script will automatically send personalized emails to each recipient individually (not CC or BCC).

This makes your email process much easier when you need to send the same message to many people.

Don't forget to write this code to the terminal or else the code won't work.

"pip install -r requirements.txt"
